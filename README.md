# MDP Music Recommendation Systen
This project explores a non-traditional approach to music recommendation by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) concepts and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The system models music recommendation as a sequential decision-making problem, where each state represents a collection of songs, and transitions between states occur based on user preferences and behavior.
The GUI displays a graph used to simulate a 4-state system  with transition probabilities derived from dirchlet's distribution and random rewards for each state, that can be manipulated through the GUI's components. 

### The current version of the project is unfinished and used for study/research related to the topics:

#### 1. Value iteration 
#### 2. Optimal policy
#### 3. Reward function
#### 4. Markov transition model
#### 5. Exploration vs. Exploatation
