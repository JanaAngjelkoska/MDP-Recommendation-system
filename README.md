# MDP Music Recommendation Systen
This project explores a non-traditional approach to music recommendation by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) concepts and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The system models music recommendation as a sequential decision-making problem, where each state represents a collection of songs, and transitions between states occur based on user preferences and behavior.
The GUI displays a graph used to simulate a 4-state system  with transition probabilities derived from dirchlet's distribution and random rewards for each state, that can be manipulated through the GUI's components. 

### The current version of the project is unfinished and used for study/research related to the topics:

#### 1. Value iteration 
#### 2. Optimal policy
#### 3. Reward function
#### 4. Markov transition model
#### 5. Exploration vs. Exploatation

## On the right side of the GUI, there is information about transition probabilities and alpha values. The alpha values can be modified in order to see how it will affect the probailities of transitioning

## The optimal policies are the result of Policy Evaluation and are shown at the bottom of the screen

## On the bottom-left corner, there are checkboxes to imitate user interaction and see how this behaviour affects the reward and the optimal policies
